+# In the case where there are multiple android devices plugged into a
+# single host, this connection command must be overriden on each device to
+# include the serial number of the device, e.g.
+#
+#   serial_number = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
+#   adb_command = adb -s %(serial_number)s
+adb_command = adb
+
+# The fastboot command.
+#
+# The same as above: if you have more than one device, you will want to
+# override this in your device config to add a serial number, e.g.
+#
+#   serial_number = XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
+#   fastboot_command = fastboot -s %(serial_number)s
+#
+# Of course, in the case you override both adb_command *and* fastboot_command,
+# you don't need to specify `serial_number` twice.

+# This is useful when the lava dispatcher is controlling the device under test which is
+# physically plugged to other machines by setting adb_command to something like
+# "ssh <phone-host> adb" and fastboot_command to something like "ssh
+# <phone-host> fastboot". adb and fastboot always operate on local files, so
+# you need your local files to also be seen as local files on the host where
+# adb/fastboot are executed.
+#
+# In this case, you should set shared_working_directory to a shared directory
+# between the machine running the dispatcher and the machine where the phone is
+# plugged.  This shared directory must have the same path in both machines.
+# For example, you can have your /var/tmp/lava mounted at /var/tmp/lava at
+# <phone-host> (or the other way around).
