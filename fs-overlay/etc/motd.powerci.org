# POWERCI: Getting started #

you may want to read /home/powerci/POWERCI/README.md

Note: I usually work with user powerci, from folder ~/POWERCI.
But it should work with another user if the token/bundle-streams/lava accounts are properly dealt with.


## Setup the Kernel tag to test ##

	vim /home/powerci/POWERCI/Makefile

* e. g.  change TAG=mainline/v4.4-rc8 to some other tag generated for kernelci storage

## Create the jobs ##

	make -C /home/powerci/POWERCI	jobs

## run the job, and create the result ##

	make -C /home/powerci/POWERCI	runner

## post to Powerci.org ##

	make -C /home/powerci/POWERCI	powerci

# Setting the Plan (Boot versus Power) #

See in the Makefile, this is hardcoded for 'power' but you can go back to 'boot' plan
by changing:

	 POWERCI_PLAN=boot
